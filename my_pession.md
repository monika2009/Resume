## The Small History Behind : How it all started ?
_My Love for bikes started when I was fifteen. It was not something different, but the same usual way of getting attracted to the **speed** and style of the bikes when I was at that age. Who cares if government provides driving license only at the age of 18. I learned to ride bikes at my 8th grade (14 yrs) from my Brother.I got the so called Driving license as soon as I reached 18 (I have to wait for a month because the rule says you must undergo a learning period of 30 days before appearing for test). So What next ? I started troubling my parents to get me the ride that i desired. Indian parents would go bankrupt if they had to buy the bikes that their children wanted ðŸ˜€ I know I cant ask for a Kawasaki Ninja , Ducati or a Harley Davidson.. In 2020 I Purchesed from my own money and It was Apache RTR 160 4v BS6 ABS._

## What Defines a Biker ? How actually does it feels to ride ?
<p> <img align="center" src="bike-quotes-for-Instagram.png" width="90%" /></p>

_When it comes to be a biker, there is something more than doing the actual riding thing and that is **The Inner Joy**. When you are traveler cum biker then I bet there is more adventure in your rides. A passionate rider always just cares for riding. **A path is enough and not the place where it leads**. According to me A rider gets joy out of riding than of the places he visits. Doesnâ€™t matter if it going to be 1500 km or 50 km but it is the satisfaction that matters the most when you ride.**You feel yourself to be in full freedom to do whatever you like to do**._

## Some Undefined Moments 

- The Joy that I get when I ride on a straight stretch of road, enjoying the sunrise or sunset.
- The Thrill that I get when I ride in pitch darkness on empty roads where my head beam light uncovers the road ahead not aware of having a Speed breaker or a pit.
- The Joy that I get when my bikeâ€™s rpm meter hits the max value, clocking top speed or beating my previous own record.
- The Joy that I get when I ride with my helmets off on a rainy day.
- The Joy that I get when I make my way correctly to my destination even after losing my track in between.
- The Joy that I get when some unknown people appreciate me for offering them a lift on time.
